And it's _really_ perfect! Some useful [markdown snippets](https://github.com/markdown-templates/markdown-snippets?tab=readme-ov-file)

## Seriously, some minimal things are needed to make this perfect.

**Ten declarations, a `@media` block, and one attribute.**

That's how much CSS and HTML it took to turn that [old](https://anthracitelabs.io/) into this finally perfect masterpiece. It's so simple and it still has all the glory:

* It's _finally_ lightweight and loads fast;
* _Finally_ fits on all your screens;
* _Finally_ looks the same in all your browsers;
* _Won't_ bleach your eyeballs at night if your browser thinks you like dark things;
* The site is _still_ accessible to everyone that visits your site;
* It's _still_ legible and gets your point across.

### And guess what:

You never knew it, but it's easy to improve reliability on your site. Here's how.

## A little more accessibility

I know you love marginalization, but you should take care of people.
The <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> tag doesn't include the [`lang` attribute](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/dom.html#the-lang-and-xml:lang-attributes) in your webpage.
You ever listen to a [wrong language screen reader lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP94u7y_KkQ)? What a bad experience.

## Typography matters

[Don't be dumb with typography](https://smartquotesforsmartpeople.com/). Don't let improper marks and quotes make their way onto websites because of dumb defaults in applications and CMSs.  
And did you let the browser choose the font? Don't make me read such text with _Times New Roman_.

## License, matters

Do you revendicate intellectual property? No. So you must [choose a public license](https://choosealicense.com/).  
And as you'll never be perfect, let others [improve your work](https://github.com/anthracitelabs/anthracitelabs.io) or [do what they want to](https://github.com/anthracitelabs.io/blob/main/LICENSE).

## Yes, this is plain simple as it should be

What I'm saying is that it's so, so simple to make sites easier to read. Websites are broken by default—they are functional, high-performing, and accessible, but they're also ugly. You and all the other web designers out there need to make them not total failure.
